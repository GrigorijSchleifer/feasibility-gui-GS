<num-app-layout></num-app-layout>
<!-- This is the root template file for the AppComponent, which serves as the main layout container for the application.
It loads the <num-app-layout> component which likely contains the core layout structure (header, navigation, main content area, etc).
All other components and views will be rendered within this layout through routing or nested components. -->
<!-- The following nested components are part of the application structure: -->

<!-- 1. num-app-layout: The main layout component that contains:
     - Header/navigation area
     - Main content container
     - Footer (if present)
     This is already rendered above -->

<!-- 2. Inside num-app-layout, through routing (app-routing.module.ts), these components can be loaded:
     - DataProtectionComponent (visible in app.module.ts declarations)
     - Other routed components defined in feature modules -->

<!-- 3. From the LayoutModule (imported in app.module.ts), likely contains:
     - Navigation components
     - Header components 
     - Layout structure components -->

<!-- 4. Components from CoreModule are typically services and utilities
     rather than visual components -->
